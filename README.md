# Project-Management-System
It is very tedious to find and manage projects and research papers using manual or classical processes. The main goal of this project is to build an integrated framework to help the users find projects that suit their needs. Project management system is a system for the management and supervision of projects and research papers. It is a management system that is useful to students, project managers, as well as professors.
In the proposed project we will develop a system to manage the ongoing/completed projects in the university. Students and professors can make their profiles on the system, and provide details of their specialization. Accordingly, the system can help them find a project that suits their needs. The users are able to obtain information about relevant projects/research papers and form teams.
